Solved problem: Teaching Assistant Evaluation

This paper addresses the problem of multiclass classification based on the Teaching Assistant Evaluation (TAE) dataset. The dataset is obtained from the KEEL repository (https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=188) and represents a standard example of a classification problem in the field of education.

The task is to be solved using one of the following approaches:

Artificial neural networks,

Genetic algorithms,

or a combination of these methods.

Python is recommended as the primary programming language. MATLAB may be used for quick verification of the selected algorithm and for result validation. A discussion is provided on the advantages and disadvantages of the chosen model.
